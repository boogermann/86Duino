and most popular 32-bit x86 RTOS.

#### About DMP Electronic Inc. ####

Established in Taiwan since 1989, DMP Electronics Inc. has focused on kernel 
technology of x86 embedded in hardware development and manufacture. Except the 
standard x86 embedded Single-Board-Computer products, DMP expands services 
covering the design and manufacture of OEM /ODM for many years, such as Power 
Application, ATM, Medical, Equipment, Home Entertainment, Automation, Metering 
Control Module, Gate System, etc. DMP also provides clients with the complete 
technical support relating Linux and Windows Embedded OS. In response to 
client!|s multiple demands, DMP has released serial application products, 
such as Touch Panel PC, Netbook (Edubook), Keyboard PC and Auto Vehicle 
Locator (AVL). All of them are based on x86 SoC embedded technologies.

Believing that Robotics is an important topic in the future industry, DMP is 
being involved in the development of advanced robot technology. Especially, 
several open-source projects related to Robotics are developed or working in 
progress, including humanoid and hexapod robots, integrated controllers for 
LinuxCNC, the RoBoard robot controller, and the 86Duino open-hardware platform.
