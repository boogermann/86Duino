86Duino
---------

_VERSION_: Coding 100

This is the IDE of the open-source 86Duino electronic platforms, which is 
compatible to Arduino 1.5.2. The binaries of this IDE for Windows, Linux, 
and Mac can be downloaded from: http://www.86duino.com/?page_id=2

If you find any software/hardware bug, or want to provide software patches or 
to request enhancements about 86Duino, please report to the 86Duino 
forum: http://www.86duino.com/?page_id=85


#### INSTALLATION ####

For Windows and Mac, since the 86Duino IDE is compatible to 
Arduino 1.5.2, you can refer to Arduino's guide for installation 
instructions: http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage

For Linux, you can also follow Arduino's guide to install the 86Duino IDE, but 
before that, you should install DOSBOX (http://www.dosbox.com/) first.


#### CREDITS ####

86Duino is an open source project based on Arduino, RoBoard, FreeDOS, DJGPP, 
DOSBOX, coreboot and SeaBIOS. Everyone contributing to those projects is 
gratefully acknowledged.

The 86Duino boards are designed by Hao Wei Chiu. And the software and firmware 
are developed by Android Lin and Oswald Kuo. All of them are members of the 
RoBoard team of DMP Electronic Inc.

There are also people and organizations in Taiwan who motivate, assist, and/or 
contribut the development of 86Duino. Detailed list can be seen in credits.txt.

#### About DMP Electronic Inc. ####

Established in Taiwan since 1989, DMP Electronics Inc. has focused on kernel 
technology of x86 embedded in hardware development and manufacture. Except the 
standard x86 embedded Single-Board-Computer products, DMP expands services 
covering the design and manufacture of OEM /ODM for many years, such as Power 
Application, ATM, Medical, Equipment, Home Entertainment, Automation, Metering 
Control Module, Gate System, etc. DMP also provides clients with the complete 
technical support relating Linux and Windows Embedded OS. In response to 
client's multiple demands, DMP has released serial application products, 
such as Touch Panel PC, Netbook (Edubook), Keyboard PC and Auto Vehicle 
Locator (AVL). All of them are based on x86 SoC embedded technologies.

Believing that Robotics is an important topic in the future industry, DMP is 
being involved in the development of advanced robot technology. Especially, 
several open-source projects related to Robotics are developed or working in 
progress, including humanoid and hexapod robots, integrated controllers for 
LinuxCNC, the RoBoard robot controller, and the 86Duino open-hardware platform.
