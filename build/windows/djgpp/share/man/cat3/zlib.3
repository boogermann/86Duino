       The  _z_l_i_b  library  is  a general purpose data compression
       library.  The code is thread safe, assuming that the stan-
       dard  library functions used are thread safe, such as mem-
       ory allocation routines.  It provides  in-memory  compres-
       sion  and  decompression  functions,  including  integrity
       checks of the uncompressed  data.   This  version  of  the
       library  supports  only one compression method (deflation)
       but other algorithms may be  added  later  with  the  same
       stream interface.

       Compression  can  be  done in a single step if the buffers
       are large enough or can be done by repeated calls  of  the
       compression function.  In the latter case, the application
       must provide more input and/or consume the output (provid-
       ing more output space) before each call.

       The  library  also  supports  reading and writing files in
       _g_z_i_p(1) (.gz) format with an interface similar to that  of
       stdio.

       The  library  does  not  install  any signal handler.  The
       decoder checks the consistency of the compressed data,  so
       the  library  should  never crash even in the case of cor-
       rupted input.

       All functions of the compression library are documented in
       the  file  _z_l_i_b_._h.  The distribution source includes exam-
       ples of use of the library in the files _t_e_s_t_/_e_x_a_m_p_l_e_._c and
       _t_e_s_t_/_m_i_n_i_g_z_i_p_._c_,  as  well  as other examples in the _e_x_a_m_-
       _p_l_e_s_/ directory.

       Changes  to  this  version  are  documented  in  the  file
       _C_h_a_n_g_e_L_o_g that accompanies the source.

       Before reporting a problem, please check the _z_l_i_b web site
       to verify that you have the latest version of _z_l_i_b; other-
       wise,  obtain  the  latest  version and see if the problem
       still exists.  Please read the _z_l_i_b FAQ at:

              http://zlib.net/zlib_faq.html

       before asking for help.  Send questions and/or comments to
       zlib@gzip.org,  or (for the Windows DLL version) to Gilles
