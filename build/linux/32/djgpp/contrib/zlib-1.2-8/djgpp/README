This is a port of zlib 1.2.8 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        The only DJGPP specific change is that vsnprintf and snprintf functions
        from DJGPP's repository are provided.  Apart from this, only the usual
        configuration files have been added.  As usual they are located in the
        /djgpp directory.

        Please read the docs.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 zlib128b.zip      or
          djtarx zlib128b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d zlib128b.zip



3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 zlib128s.zip      or
          djtarx zlib128s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d zlib128s.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh204b.zip  (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, gppNNN.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip,
          shlNNNb.zip, txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip, grepNNNb.zip, and
          sedNNNb.zip

        If you want to run the check you will need also:
          difNNNb.zip

        All this packages can be found in the v2gnu directory of ftp.delorie.com
        and any mirror.  NNN stands for the newest port versions available when
        this port was build but older may do the work as well.

3.3.:   The package has been configured for both DJGPP 2.03 and DJGPP 2.04.
        There is a separate build directory for DJGPP 2.03 and for DJGPP 2.04
        under the top srcdir (aka zlib-1.2-8).  To build the binaries
        using the 2.03 version of DJGPP cd into _build.203; if you prefer to
        build the binaries using DJGPP 2.04 cd into _build.204.  If for some
        reason you want to reconfigure the package cd into the corresponding
        build directory and run the following commands:
          del config.cache
          make clean
          ..\djgpp\config ./..

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the djgpp
        subdir or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.

        config.bat, among other things, will start the configure script passing
        to it a couple of arguments.  You can control these argument passing the
        following command line arguments to config.bat:
          nls or no-nls, default no-nls.  No NLS support.
          cache or no-cache, default cache.
          dep or no-dep, default no-dep.  No dependency tracking.
          silent or no-silent, default silent.  Controls the verbosity of the
                                                build process.
        All other configure specific options are not controled by config.bat so
        they are passed verbatim to the configure script if they are supplied.
        If no arguments are passed to config.bat then the default values are
        used.


        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\contrib\zlib-1.2-8\djgpp\config x:/src/contrib/zlib-1.2-8

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\contrib\zlib-1.2-8\djgpp\config x:/src/contrib/zlib-1.2-8

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter.  You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.in's and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.

3.4.:   To compile the package run from the directory where you have configured
        the sources the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like. From the directory where you have
        configured the sources run the command:
          make test

        No test should fail.

3.6.:   To install the binaries, header, library, catalogs, and info docs
        run the following command from the top srcdir:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/place
