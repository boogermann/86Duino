This is a port of GNU grep 2.5.4 to MSDOS/DJGPP.

1.:     DJGPP specific changes.
        =======================

        To be able to compile a working grep binary using djdev203 certain
        adjustements to src/system.h are needed so directory detections works.
        If this is not done the '-r' will not work and given the EACCES error
        message every time a directory is tried to be searched.  This changes
        are not required when using djdev204.  Here everything works out of
        the box.
        When paths are checked to be directories, the code has been changed to
        use access() instead of stat().  Due to amount of work that it is to
        compute the stat of the file, using access() should give certain speed
        improvement.
        This port offers colorization support.  Please read the documentation
        to learn how the default colors used can be changed.

        ATTENTION: When compiling this package do *not* follow the instructions
        in README.DOS.  Do *not* try to use autoconf and automake to remake the
        configure script and the Makefile.ins.  It is not needed and it will
        not work.  Proceed as usual using the files provided in the /djgpp dir.

        Please **read** the docs.


2.:     Installing the binary package.
        ==============================

2.1.:   Copy the binary distribution into the top DJGPP installation directory,
        just unzip it preserving the directory structure running *ONE* of the
        following commands:
          unzip32 grep254b.zip      or
          djtarx grep254b.zip       or
          pkunzip -d grep254b.zip


3.:     Building the binaries from sources.
        ===================================

3.1.:   Create a temporary directory and copy the source package into the
        directory.  If you download the source distribution from one of the
        DJGPP sites, just unzip it preserving the directory structure
        running *ONE* of the following commands:
          unzip32 grep254s.zip      or
          djtarx grep254s.zip       or
          pkunzip -d grep254s.zip

3.2.:   To build the binaries you will need the following binary packages:
          djdev203.zip (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          bsh204b.zip  (or a later but NOT a prior version)
          gccNNNb.zip, gppNNN.zip, bnuNNNb.zip, makNNNb.zip, filNNNb.zip,
          shlNNNb.zip, txtNNNb.zip, txiNNNb.zip, grepNNNb.zip, sedNNNb.zip.

        If you want to run the check you will need also:
          difNNNb.zip

        NNN represents the latest version number of the binary packages.  All
        this packages can be found in the /v2gnu directory of any
        ftp.delorie.com mirror.
        You will need bsh204b.zip or later and *NOT* a prior version or
        the build will fail.  The same applies to djdev203.zip.

3.3.:   If for some reason you want to reconfigure the package cd into the top
        srcdir (grep-2.5-4) and run the following commands:
          del djgpp\config.cache
          make clean
          djgpp\config

        Please note that you *MUST* delete the config.cache file in the djgpp
        subdir or you will not really reconfigure the sources because the
        configuration informations will be read from the cache file instead
        of being newly computed.
        To build the programs in a directory other than where the sources are,
        you must add the parameter that specifies the source directory,
        e.g:
          x:\src\gnu\grep-2.5-4\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/grep-2.5-4

        Lets assume you want to build the binaries in a directory placed on a
        different drive (z:\build in this case) from where the sources are,
        then you will run the following commands:
          z:
          md \build
          cd \build
          x:\src\gnu\grep-2.5-4\djgpp\config x:/src/gnu/grep-2.5-4

        The order of the options and the srcdir option does not matter.  You
        *MUST* use forward slashes to specify the source directory.

        The batch file will set same environment variables, make MSDOS specific
        modifications to the Makefile.in's and supply all other needed options
        to the configure script.

3.4.:   To compile the package run from the top srcdir the command:
          make

3.5.:   Now you can run the tests if you like.  CD into the /tests directory
        and run the command:
          make check

        One test will fail.

3.6.:   To install the binaries, and info docs run the following command from
        the top srcdir:
          make install

        This will install the products into your DJGPP installation tree given
        by the default prefix "/dev/env/DJDIR".  If you prefer to install them
        into some other directory you will have to set prefix to the appropiate
        value:
          make install prefix=z:/some/other/place
