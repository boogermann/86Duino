* Add the critical sections in pinMode(), analogWrite(), analogRead().

[libraries]
* Add Audio library to play the .wav file in SD card for 86Duino ONE.
* Add FreeIMU1 library to access the GYRO sensor on 86Duino ONE.

* Add Capa(CapacitiveSensorDue) library.
* Add OneWire library.
* Update Ethernet library.
  Modify MAX_SOCK_NUM from 4 to 128.
  Add begin() without mac address parameter.
  Add Ethernet.localmac() (read the mac address of 86Duino).
* Modify EEPROM library.
  In CMOS, two bytes (20 and 22 bytes) are used by BIOS or other program. We use 26 and 27 bytes to replace them.
  Add a new setBank().
  Add EEPROM_200B and EEPROM_16K parameters for setBank().
* Modify TWI library to work fine if the SDA's state is LOW after soft-reset.



### CODING 101 - 2013.12.27 ###

[ide]
* Update BasicUploader.java to use the new Hehuan bootloader.
* Update DuinoCompiler.java to compile with third party DOS library.
* Modify build.varaint in board.txt to match them in variants directory.
* Add the ethernet .h files into DJGPP/include and .a file into DJGPP/lib for all platforms.
* Update uploader to support the older bootloader for compatibility.

[core]
* Add Serial232 for the RS232 port of 86Duino EduCake.
* Serial4 is now an alias of Serial485 for 86Duino ONE.
* Serial6 is now an alias of Serial232 for 86Duino EduCake.
* Modify soft-reset method to match Arduino Leonardo.
* Add 600, 14400, 28800 baudrate to com.cpp and uart.cpp.

[libraries]
* Update the EEPROM library to implement 16KB EEPROM using the reserved spaces 
  in the SPI flash and CMOS of 86Duino.
* Finish and test the old Wifi library (ported from Arduino 1.5.2) and the new 
  Wifi library (ported from Arduino 1.5.5).
* Add Ethernet library
* Add TFT library
* Modify a bug for SD library to let TFTBitmapLogo work normally.
  File.cpp => seek() => fseek(_file, pos, SEEK_CUR) change to fseek(_file, pos, SEEK_SET) 
* Modify a bug for Servo library to let servo work normally if you use servo.write(1500) in loop().
  Comment "if(servos[channel].ticks == value) return;"

[bootloader]
* A new and rigorous bootloader protocol.
* The bootloader is now named as Hehuan.
* Update bootloader to support the older uploader for compatibility.



### CODING 100r3 - 2013.12.01 ###

[ide]
* Support Mac OS X.

[bootloader]
* Fix a USB descriptor issue that only occurs in Mac OS X.



### CODING 100r2 - 2013.11.17 ###

[ide]
* Support Linux (only tested on Ubuntu 10.04, 11.04, 12.04, and 13.04).



### CODING 100 - 2013.11.12 ###

[ide]
* Modify the GUI appearance.
* Allow to upload the bootloader via IDE.

[core]
* All of Arduino standard API (except USB keyboard and mouse) are implemented 
  and tested. Many bugs of standard API from the implementation of Coding 080
  are fixed.
* Fix a string-buffer-size bug in String::concat(int num) and 
  String::concat(unsigned int num) of Wstring.cpp.
* Add Serial4 for the RS232 port of 86Duino EduCake.
* Add Serial485 for the RS485 port of 86Duino One.
* Remove the index() function in DJGPP/include/string.h to avoid the 
  function name conflict problem occuring in an sketch example 
  from the Arduino 1.5.2 IDE.

[libraries]
* Finish and test the SD library.
* Finish and test the EEPROM library, which implements the EEPROM of 86Duino 
  using the unused CMOS space (only 200 bytes).

[bootloader]
* Remove the file size limit to sketch programs.
* Much safe memory and disk allocation approach for uploading sketches.



### CODING 080 - 2013.10.18 ###

* First public release for alpha-test users of 86Duino; althrough it can work, 
  it is still in alpha stage.
* Only Windows XP is supported.
* Most of Arduino API, except few low-level functions such as 
  attachInterrupt(), are implemented.
* Most of Arduino libraries, such as Servo, SPI, Wire, Firmata, ..., 
  are ported; however, not everyone is tested entirely.
* The bootloader works but its protocol isn't rigorous and needs further 
  enhancement.
